# Shopping-cart/Dashboard
  This is an open-ended project where I would like to take advantage of several React features, such as Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext, etc.), clientPortal, and many others. I have connected the client-side to a MongoDB document that stores the items added to the cart. I have also added a sidebar that contains switches to activate different widgets. These widgets are then rendered on the home page using clientPortal and their current state is saved in localStorage so that the dashboard remains the same when the user revisits the page. I am using these widgets as an opportunity to connect to a variety of APIs that provide data, such as weather, stock metrics, daily quotes, etc. After adding most of the core functionality to the dashboard, I plan on making the user interface more interactive and allow users to drag and drop widgets to their desired position on the page. This project has been a great way to learn more about submitting HTTP requests from a form or button on the front-end and providing a response from an API or MongoDB. I also enjoy learning how React can you help build reusable components and easily control when they are rendered.
